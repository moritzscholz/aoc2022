# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

## How to run

The project is managed with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org).

1. Install the dependencies: `poetry install`
1. Run `main.py` to get all solutions: `poetry run python main.py`

## Folder structure

* `src/` contains a folder for each day which contains the input data and solution.
* `tests/` has tests using the `PyTest`-framework. You can run them with `poetry run pytest tests/`
